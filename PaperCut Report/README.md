This is one of the first functional Powershell script I ever produced, it is here as a reminder to myself of where I started. It is very inificient and could be improved greatly. I might do so in the future.

This script can be great to learn on, but should never be used in production.

It requires:
 * PaperCut print logger on your windows server print servers.
 * CSVfix to remove a line in the CSV files created by PaperCut.
